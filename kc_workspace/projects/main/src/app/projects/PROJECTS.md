# How we structure Projects in Angular

Though the component files are in a flat list in the repository, there is inherently a hierarchical structure to
 the isntantiation of each component. The following illustrates this implicit structure:
 
 **Projects**
 - Project Sidebar
    - Project Navigation
        - Tabs
            - Project Tree View
                - Project Creation
                - Project View Settings
                - Project Tree
                    - Project Name
                - Project Context Menu
 - Project Detail 
    - Project Metadata
    - Project Tags
    - Project Resources
        - List of Agents
        - List of Transformers
