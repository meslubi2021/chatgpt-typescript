# Description
Knowledge is an open-source bookmark manager, file explorer, calendar, and project management tool. Knowledge allows users to import, organize, filter, and search nearly any digital resource, including files, web links, calendar entries, and more. Create your own personal knowledge base, visualize connections between projects and resources, easily extract content from documents, and review a timeline of your progress and activity.

# Security and Privacy
The app relies exclusively on local storage and local processes. There are no servers involved (except an _optional_ local Docker instance of Tika Server) and local documents never leave your computer. Future versions may include opt-in reporting services to enhance functionality and improve support.

# Disclaimer
This software is not a finished product and provides no warranty of any kind. You are welcome to open an issue or a pull request. Contributors are welcome.

As of Feb 2022, there is a good chance that _something_ in the app is not working properly, simply because it has not been fully implemented yet. No extensive testing has been conducted on Windows or Linux. It is very likely that something is broken on one or both of those platforms. Testing and verification on either platform is welcome.
